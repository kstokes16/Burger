# Burger
Eat Da Burger App

## Functionality
Within the app, a user is able to:

* Add a burger they would like to devour
* Choose to devour one of the burgers that is already available on the menu
* Add a burger they would like to devour and devour that same burger

## Problems
I am having trouble communicating with my DB, so right now I am unable to devour a burger and add a new burger to the database from the client-side. 

* Also having trouble getting this to deploy to Heroku correctly
